## Overview
<h1>The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a breast mass is malignant or benign based on features such as size, shape, texture, and other characteristics extracted from diagnostic images.</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<h3>The dataset used for this project is load_breast_cancer. <br></h3>

<h2>Dependecies</h2>

## Libraries: 
```bash
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```
