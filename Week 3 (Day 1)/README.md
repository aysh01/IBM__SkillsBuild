Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a breast mass is malignant or benign based on features such as size, shape, texture, and other characteristics extracted from diagnostic images.

Models
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network (optional if applicable)
