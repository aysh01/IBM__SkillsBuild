Models
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this project, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Network (optional if applicable)
Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation or train-test split was used to ensure robust evaluation.
